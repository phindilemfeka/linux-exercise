A soft whisper from nature has entered my breath
I swallowed and inhaled it to my lungs' deepest depth
and now it is tickling my heart and my mind
It keeps humming a song of love and being kind

Whenever I feel lazy to give help to a friend,
it will make me reach out anyhow a loving hand.
The small voice gives me peace and harmony;
it awakens a sense of the beauty of reality

It encourages me to stop living based on my greed
It reminds me that grace and love is a much bigger need.
Dear small whisper of nature, please do not leave me
I cherish you so much, feel welcome to stay eternally
